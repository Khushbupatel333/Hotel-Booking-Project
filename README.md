# Data Cleaning and Feature engineering:-

1)Removing duplicate values:- All duplicate values were dropped.

2)Handling null and missing values:- I found some null and missing values in data in column is_cancelled,is_repeated_guest and previous_cancellation.I replace th√†t null values with average of that column

3)Converting and updating format and datatype of columns:-I change datatype of some columns.

Mainly used libraries are matplotlib and seaborn and the following graphs and plots are:-

- Bar plot
- Histogram
- scatter plot
- Line chart
- Heatmap
- pair plot
- Box plot

# Conclusion:-

- A city hotel is has more bookings than resort.Offer packeges and promote bookings for resort hotel.

- BB is most requested food .The hotel should maintain the food quality while offering discount on other foods to promotr other

- Most of bookings are made from online plateform .

- Very few customer visited again.So hotel can increase repeate bookings by offering the right repeat booking insentive.

- Because room A and D are most popular with customer the hotel should maintain the quality.

- Customer do not want to pay pre-deposit for a reservation.Hotels should promote advance deposit because not only does an advance.
